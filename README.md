# Monster Themes
Need help with the themes? Visit the [Black Box](https://discord.gg/TeRQEPb).

The Phoenix Bundle are forks of old themes that have ceased to be supported. Because I have been maintaining them for a year and have rewritten them to be more readable and efficient, I have renamed them and claimed them as my own.

The code itself is loads different but the output does still look the same.

Black Hole is an original theme that is easier to maintain.

All themes will be hopefully ported to BDv2 soon.
